## My process

I completed this project using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  I was able to get the basic layout completed, but ran into issues trying to get the cards container to vertically center in the display.  After a lot of trial and error and searching for vertical aligning tutorials, I ultimately got help by looking at Max Kaiser's solution.  Still after a little bit more trial and error I was ultimately able to complete the project.

### Built with

- HTML
-CSS
-Bootstrap

### What I learned

I gained a better understanding of CSS/Bootstrap display options and how they effect the page.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I still have a ways to go in fully understanding how all the display options effect the page.  I hope to gain that knowledge with more projects, as well as streamlining/simplifying my code.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://github.com/maxkaiser100/qrcode) - Max's code really helped me to figure out vertically centering my qr code "box."
